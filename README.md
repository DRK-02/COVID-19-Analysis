# COVID-19-Analysis

The main objective of this project is to make multiple models that predicts confirmed COVID-19 Cases. Mainly, 2 algorithms have been used:
•	Linear Regression
•	Polynomial Regression

To create more models, multiple degrees has been using in the polynomial regression algorithm. A total of 15 models have been made and the accuracy plot of all the 15 models is shown below. Each model was made taking only 1 or a combination of multiple variables provided by the data set. The data set was obtained from Kaggle.

The best model from all these is "Linear Regression - Prediction using All Variables".
